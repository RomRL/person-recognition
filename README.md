#  AI-Driven Person Recognition and Matching in Videos Using ConvLSTM

## Project Overview

Our project is focused on developing an advanced system leveraging artificial intelligence and neural networks, particularly using Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) models. The primary objective is to create a sophisticated video person identification system capable of accurately detecting individuals in videos, extracting key features such as facial and body structures, and matching these features against a database to identify specific persons of interest.

## Problem Statement

The challenge we are addressing is multi-faceted. We aim to achieve accurate person detection in video footage, comprehensive feature extraction, and efficient matching against a database to identify a specific person. Our system must navigate complex variations in appearance, movement, and environmental conditions within video data. Furthermore, ethical considerations regarding the handling of sensitive biometric information, prioritizing privacy and consent, are integral to our project.
